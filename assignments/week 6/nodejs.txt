NodeJS
    -  an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
        - allows us to run JS outside of the browser
    - Allows us to use JS for every tier of an application

NVM
    - Node Version Manager
        - allows us to easily switch between node Versions
        - https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
            - scoop install nvm
            - nvm install "lts"
            - nvm use "lts"

Node Package Manager (npm)
    - included with NodeJS installation
    - one of the world's largest software registry
        - free to use
    - 3 main components
        - website
            - navigate, discover packages
        - CLI tool
            - npm command
        - registry
            - database of JS software available for download
    - npm init
        - initializes a new JS project
            - generates the package.json
                - like the pom.xml
                - lists the dependencies used
                - metadata about the project
    - node_modules
        - folder that contains all of the dependencies required to run an npm project
            - when cloning/pulling an npm project, run npm install to install the dependencies locally
        - good practice is to .gitignore the node_modules folder
            - otherwise, all the dependencies get pushed to GitHub
        - managed by npm
            - npm install
            - npm uninstall
    - package-lock.json
        - specifies the exact version of the dependencies and required sub-dependencies so that the project is 100% reproducible
