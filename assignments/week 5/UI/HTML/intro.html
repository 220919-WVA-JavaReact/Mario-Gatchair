                 HTML tags/elements
                     Used to indicate how content should be displayed. Usually
                     will require an opening and a closing tag, those that do
                     not require closing tags are known as "self-closing" tags.

                 Attributes
                         HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional
                         information about the contents of an element. They appear
                         within the opening tags of an HTML element, and are made of
                         two parts: a name/key, and a value. The name and the value are
                         separated by an equals sign (=). The value of an attribute is 
                         encapsulated within double quotes ("").
